# Data Science With Python

<https://www.theforage.com/modules/mq38jBo7o3z25RQQb/3HdYrCTaRJpPZYeiG?ref=SfSqDihCcvSen4csq>

## Background information

Now that you understand the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM), and have an idea of the business needs, it is time to understand the data, prepare for modelling and, of course, train a model. As a data scientist, it is important to know the tools that are available to you to perform your daily tasks and know when to use each tool. The tools available have advanced to automated techniques but automated is not always better. Your manager has been approached by some cloud service provider and promises that automated is the way to go. He wants you to investigate if that is indeed true.

## Tasks

In this task, you will make use of automated machine learning as well as traditional machine learning. The manager of the home loans department, who has provided us with sample data, wants to know a few things about the data. The questions about the data can be found in the notebook provided in the Resources section below.

The manager is also interested in understanding what machine learning really is with particular use case.

We will use Python and its extensive collection of libraries to derive valuable insights from the data, prepare the data and train machine learning models - the old fashioned way and in newer, automated ways. We have provided two datasets in the form of CSVs and Jupyter Notebook. The notebook has been annotated to assist you.
