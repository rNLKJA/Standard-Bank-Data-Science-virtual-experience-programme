## Background information

As a data scientist, you will be required to present your findings. This tests just how well you understood the business problem and business objectives. Donâ€™t forget that the manager of the home loans department has a limited technical background and is more focused on the business aspect. As you present, make sure to focus your discussion on the business aspect and not so much on the technical details.

In this task, you will prepare to present your findings. You will be presenting to the manager of the home loans department and also your manager and team.

## Tasks

Film a 5 to 10-minute video presentation outlining your findings from the previous task. Upload it below once done. Remember to not be too technical!
