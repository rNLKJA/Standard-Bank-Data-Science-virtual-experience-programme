# Preparing to Present

<https://www.theforage.com/modules/mq38jBo7o3z25RQQb/zENaxKY7L8TkrgYEK?ref=SfSqDihCcvSen4csq>

## Background information

As a data scientist, you will be required to present your findings. This tests just how well you understood the business problem and business objectives. The manager of the home loans department, like many other project sponsors you might have to present to, has a limited technical background. Her interest is business-oriented, so you should discuss your results in terms of the business problem with minimal technical details.

In this task, you will prepare to present not only to the manager of the home loans department but also to your manager/team.

## Tasks

To cover the above considerations, we recommend you structure the presentation in a similar manner to the template provided in Resources.

Other considerations include the following:

1. Keep it simple by using business terms
2. Visuals make things easier to understand
3. Define any terms that might be too technical before (or right after) you use/mention them
4. Try to tell a story

Alongside the template, we recommend some more specific things:

- Include the data science life cycle. Define and explain how it works as well as how you used it.
- The project overview shows the manager that you understood the business and goal. With the hypothesis, it is recommended to say something like ‘’With ML, we can do (insert what you have done) such that the (insert business objective) is met”.
- The process overview is a high-level view of how the problem becomes a solution. This shows through visuals or points, how the business problem is solved using machine learning. Prototype, demo, high-level architectures or wireframes showing how the end user will engage with the solution usually works best.
- In the data section, it is always a good idea to discuss high-level information about the data you were working with. This includes the size of the data and the data types.
- With the analysis, only show two or three interesting insights (remember that visuals make things easier)
- In the modelling section, you are sharing what you tried (remember not to get too technical; use the model you trained, and mention that AutoML was also used)
- With evaluation, draw up comparisons between the two but remember that this might be new to the home loans department manager.
- For recommendations, this is an opportunity to impress your team lead by giving your input on if you should go with AutoML or Bespoke ML.

Note that the sections in the template can be mixed up to tell your story and that not all the analysis needs to be included.
